  ##
  # Expects that the routing of the given +path+ was handled correctly and that the parsed options (given in the +expected_options+ hash)
  # match +path+. Basically, it asserts that \Rails recognizes the route given by +expected_options+.
  #
  # Pass a hash in the second argument (+path+) to specify the request method. This is useful for routes
  # requiring a specific HTTP method. The hash should contain a :path with the incoming request path
  # and a :method containing the required HTTP verb.
  #
  #   # assert that POSTing to /items will call the create action on ItemsController
  #   assert_recognizes({controller: 'items', action: 'create'}, {path: 'items', method: :post})
  #
  # You can also pass in +extras+ with a hash containing URL parameters that would normally be in the query string. This can be used
  # to assert that values in the query string string will end up in the params hash correctly. To test query strings you must use the
  # extras argument, appending the query string on the path directly will not work. For example:
  #
  #   # Expect that a path of '/items/list/1?view=print' returns the correct options
  #   'items/list/1'.must_route_from({controller: 'items', action: 'list', id: '1', view: 'print'}, { view: "print" })
  #
  # The +message+ parameter allows you to pass in an error message that is displayed upon failure.

  #   # Check the default route (i.e., the index action)
  #   'items'.must_route_from({controller: 'items', action: 'index'})
  #
  #   # Test a specific action

  ##
  # Expects that path and options match both ways; in other words, it verifies that <tt>path</tt> generates
  # <tt>options</tt> and then that <tt>options</tt> generates <tt>path</tt>. This essentially combines +assert_recognizes+
  # and +assert_generates+ into one step.
  #
  # The +extras+ hash allows you to specify options that would normally be provided as a query string to the action. The

  # An expectation that selects elements and makes one or more equality tests.
  #
  # If the first argument is an element, selects all matching elements
  # starting from (and including) that element and all its children in
  # depth-first order.
  #
  # If no element if specified, calling +must_select+ selects from the
  # response HTML unless +must_select+ is called from within an +must_select+ block.
  #
  # When called with a block +must_select+ passes an array of selected elements
  # to the block. Calling +must_select+ from the block, with no element specified,
  # runs the expectation on the complete set of elements selected by the enclosing expectation.
  # Alternatively the array may be iterated through so that +must_select+ can be called
  # separately for each element.
  #
  #
  # ==== Example
  # If the response contains two ordered lists, each with four list elements then:
  #   must_select "ol" do |elements|
  #     elements.each do |element|
  #       must_select element, "li", 4
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # will pass, as will:
  #   must_select "ol" do
  #     must_select "li", 8
  #   end
  #
  # The selector may be a CSS selector expression (String), an expression
  # with substitution values, or an HTML::Selector object.
  #
  # === Equality Tests
  #
  # The equality test may be one of the following:
  # * <tt>true</tt> - Assertion is true if at least one element selected.
  # * <tt>false</tt> - Assertion is true if no element selected.
  # * <tt>String/Regexp</tt> - Assertion is true if the text value of at least
  #   one element matches the string or regular expression.
  # * <tt>Integer</tt> - Assertion is true if exactly that number of
  #   elements are selected.
  # * <tt>Range</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected
  #   elements fit the range.
  # If no equality test specified, the expectation is true if at least one
  # element selected.
  #
  # To perform more than one equality tests, use a hash with the following keys:
  # * <tt>:text</tt> - Narrow the selection to elements that have this text
  #   value (string or regexp).
  # * <tt>:html</tt> - Narrow the selection to elements that have this HTML
  #   content (string or regexp).
  # * <tt>:count</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected elements
  #   is equal to this value.
  # * <tt>:minimum</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected
  #   elements is at least this value.
  # * <tt>:maximum</tt> - Assertion is true if the number of selected
  #   elements is at most this value.
  #
  # If the method is called with a block, once all equality tests are
  # evaluated the block is called with an array of all matched elements.
  #
  #   # At least one form element
  #   must_select "form"
  #
  #   # Form element includes four input fields
  #   must_select "form input", 4
  #
  #   # Page title is "Welcome"
  #   must_select "title", "Welcome"
  #
  #   # Page title is "Welcome" and there is only one title element
  #   must_select "title", {count: 1, text: "Welcome"},
  #       "Wrong title or more than one title element"
  #
  #   # Page contains no forms
  #   must_select "form", false, "This page must contain no forms"
  #
  #   # Test the content and style
  #   must_select "body div.header ul.menu"
  #
  #   # Use substitution values
  #   must_select "ol>li#?", /item-\d+/
  #
  #   # All input fields in the form have a name

  #   * <tt>:count</tt>: either a number or a range which must equal (or

  #     to match on the children, and only matching children will be
  #     counted.
  # * <tt>:content</tt>: the textual content of the node must match the
