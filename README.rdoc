== Install

    gem install minitest-rails

This installs the following gems:

    minitest

== Configure

Create a new rails app without Test::Unit:

    rails new MyApp --skip-test-unit

Add <tt>minitest-rails</tt> to the Gemfile:

    gem "minitest-rails"

Next run the installation generator with the following:

    rails generate mini_test:install

This will add the <tt>test_helper.rb</tt> file to the <tt>test</tt> directory.

== Usage

This project aims to enable MiniTest within the Rails TestCase classes.
Your test will continue to inherit from <tt>ActiveSupport::TestCase</tt>, which will now support the spec DSL.
You can generate test files with the standard model, controller, resource, and other generators:

    rails generate model User

And you can specify generating the tests using the <tt>MiniTest::Spec</tt> DSL on any of the generators by providing the <tt>--spec</tt> option:

    rails generate model User --spec

And you can specify not generating the fixture for a model by providing the <tt>--skip-fixture</tt> option:

    rails generate model User --skip-fixture

You can also set these as defaults by adding the following to the <tt>config/application.rb</tt> file:

    config.generators do |g|
      g.test_framework :mini_test, :spec => true, :fixture => false
    end
    
To run your tests, minitest-rails provides multiple rake tasks by default, for a complete list, simply run <tt>rake -T</tt>.

You can also add any directories under <tt>test/</tt> and minitest-rails will automatically create the associated rake task for it. So let say you add a <tt>test/api/</tt> directory, <tt>rake minitest:api</tt> will automagically be available.

If you want to automatically run <tt>rake minitest:api</tt> when you call <tt>rake minitest</tt>, add this line to a new .rake file under <tt>lib/tasks/</tt>:

    MiniTest::Rails::Testing.default_tasks << 'api'

== Running on Ruby 1.8

Efforts have been made to be compatible with Ruby 1.8.7, but some rough edges may remain. For the latest information on 1.8 compatibility see the wiki: https://github.com/blowmage/minitest-rails/wiki/Running-on-1.8

== Capybara

You can use Capybara for feature tests by adding <tt>minitest-rails-capybara</tt> as a dependency. See the README for more information: https://github.com/blowmage/minitest-rails-capybara

== Upgrading

The 0.9 release marks a new direction for minitest-rails. Deprecations have been added for the features that won't make it to 1.0. See instructions for upgrading to 0.9: https://github.com/blowmage/minitest-rails/wiki/Upgrading-to-0.9

== Incompatibilities

Existing tests that call <tt>describe</tt> will not work, since <tt>describe</tt> is used by <tt>MiniTest::Spec</tt> blocks.
