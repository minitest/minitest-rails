== Install

    gem install minitest-rails

This installs the following gems:

    minitest

== Configure

Create a new rails app:

    rails new MyApp

Add <tt>minitest-rails</tt> to the Gemfile:

    gem "minitest-rails"

If you are running Rails 4.0 or earlier, be sure to specify a 1.x release in the Gemfile:

    gem "minitest-rails", "~> 1.0"

Next run the installation generator with the following:

    rails generate minitest:install

This will add the <tt>test_helper.rb</tt> file to the <tt>test</tt> directory.

== Usage

This project aims to enable Minitest within the Rails TestCase classes.
Your test will continue to inherit from <tt>ActiveSupport::TestCase</tt>, which will now support the spec DSL.
You can generate test files with the standard model, controller, resource, and other generators:

    rails generate model User

And you can specify generating the tests using the <tt>Minitest::Spec</tt> DSL on any of the generators by providing the <tt>--spec</tt> option:

    rails generate model User --spec

And you can specify not generating the fixture for a model by providing the <tt>--skip-fixture</tt> option:

    rails generate model User --skip-fixture

You can also set these as defaults by adding the following to the <tt>config/application.rb</tt> file:

    config.generators do |g|
      g.test_framework :minitest, spec: true, fixture: false
    end
    
== Running Tests

To run your tests use the <tt>rake test</tt> that ship with rails. For a complete list run <tt>rake -T</tt>.

To add additional testing tasks, define them in your <tt>Rakefile</tt> or a file in <tt>lib/tasks</tt> like so:

    Rails::TestTask.new("test:presenters" => "test:prepare") do |t|
      t.pattern = "test/presenters/**/*_test.rb"
    end

If you want your new task to be run when you run <tt>rake test</tt>, also add the following:

    Rake::Task["test:run"].enhance ["test:presenters"]

== Using Rails 4.0 or earlier

For information on using minitest-rails with Rails 3.0 through 4.0, see the README for the 1.x branch: https://github.com/blowmage/minitest-rails/tree/1.x#readme

== Capybara

You can use Capybara for feature tests by adding <tt>minitest-rails-capybara</tt> as a dependency. See the README for more information: https://github.com/blowmage/minitest-rails-capybara

== RSpec Compatibility

RSpec and Minitest's spec DSL are incompatible and both cannot be loaded at the same time. If your tests using the spec DSL are not running it is likely the RSpec DSL is also loaded. Check the dependencies and make sure RSpec is only loaded when running the specs.

If you need to use some RSpec features with minitest-rails require only the needed gems. e.g. To use RSpec mocks with minitest-rails require the "rspec-mocks" gem only, and not the main "rspec" gem which activates the RSpec DSL.
