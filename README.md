# minitest-rails

Minitest integration for Rails 6.0

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/blowmage/minitest-rails.png)](http://travis-ci.org/blowmage/minitest-rails)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/blowmage/minitest-rails.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/blowmage/minitest-rails)

## Install

`gem install minitest-rails`

This installs the following gems:

* `minitest`

## Configure

Create a new rails app:

`rails new MyApp`

### Choosing a version

If you are running Rails 6.x, specify a corresponding 6.x release in the Gemfile. For example, if you are using Rails 6.0 you will specify:

```ruby
gem "minitest-rails", "~> 6.0.0"
```

If you are running Rails 5.x, specify a corresponding 5.x release in the Gemfile. For example, if you are using Rails 5.2 you will specify:

```ruby
gem "minitest-rails", "~> 5.2.0"
```

Or, if you prefer to run the previous release for Rails 5.x, specify a 3.x release in the Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "minitest-rails", "~> 3.0"
```

If you are running Rails 4.1 or 4.2, specify a 2.x release in the Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "minitest-rails", "~> 2.0"
```

If you are running Rails 4.0 or earlier, specify a 1.x release in the Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "minitest-rails", "~> 1.0"
```

### Installing

Next run the installation generator with the following:

`rails generate minitest:install`

This will add the `test_helper.rb` file to the `test` directory.

## Usage

This project aims to enable Minitest within the Rails TestCase classes.
Your test will continue to inherit from `ActiveSupport::TestCase`, which will now support the spec DSL.
You can generate test files using the `Minitest::Spec` DSL with the standard model, controller, resource, and other generators:

`rails generate model User`

And you can specify generating the tests without the `Minitest::Spec` DSL on any of the generators by providing the `--no-spec` option:

`rails generate model User --no-spec`

And you can specify not generating the fixture for a model by providing the `--skip-fixture` option:

`rails generate model User --skip-fixture`

You can also set these as defaults by adding the following to the `config/application.rb` file:

```ruby
config.generators do |g|
  g.test_framework :minitest, spec: false, fixture: false
end
```

## Running Tests

To run your tests use the `rails test` that ship with rails.
